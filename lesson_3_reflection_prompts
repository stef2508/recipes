When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

- access to my repos from everywhere
- sharing the project gives all features from the remote repo

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- still controll of my code. i can check the commit and decide if i want to pull or not
